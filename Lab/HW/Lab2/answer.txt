a. What happens when you compile without "-z execstack"
The NX protection can not be turned off to make the stack executable. 

b. What happens if you enable ASLR? Does the return address change?
It will randomly arranges the address spaces of processes, including stack, heap and libraries. The return address will change certainly.

c. Does the address of the buffer[] in memory change when you run BOF using GDB, /home/root/Desktop/Lab2-BufferOverflows/BOF, and ./BOF
Yes, it will change.
